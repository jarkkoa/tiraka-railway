# **Railways** | Data Structures and Algorithms 1 Course Project

**DISCLAIMER:** The class methods of the Datastructures class as well as the private members of the class are written by me. The rest of the code, along with the UI and the test files, was provided by the course staff.

## Introduction

This program allows the user to create rectangular regions which are displayed on the map. The user can add railway stations and trains to the map .

The goal of this project was to learn to use C++ STL containers and algorithms efficiently and to implement our own algorithms. Many different functionalities were implemented, such as finding routes between stations and creating subregions within regions.

## Build info
This project was written in C++17 using Qt 6.2.3. Configure the project for your system in Qt Creator and build.
